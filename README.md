# JavaScript Coding Problems 
This repository is a revised portfolio from a college class showcasing my ability to solve basic JavaScript coding problems. Each problem is implemented within and individual HTML which can all be accessed through index.html.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to present a collection of JavaScript problem-solving examples as part of my coding portfolio. These problems showcase my understanding of core JavaScript concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, array, and DOM manipulation, while demonstrating my approach to writing clean, readable, and efficient code.
