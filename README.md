# JavaScript Coding Problems 
This repository is a revised portfolio from a college class showcasing my ability to solve basic JavaScript coding problems. Each problem is implemented within and individual HTML which can all be accessed through ``` index.html ```.


## Purpose
The goal of this project is to present a collection of JavaScript problem-solving examples as part of my coding portfolio. These problems showcase my understanding of core JavaScript concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, array, and DOM manipulation, while demonstrating my approach to writing clean, readable, and efficient code. 

## Project Structure
```

├── htmlFiles/
│   ├── index.html        # Main index page with links to all problems
│   ├── mathFun.html        # Problem: basic math operations
│   ├── stringFun.html        # Problem: string manipulation
│   ├── Maximum50.html        # Problem: maximum characters for a text box
│   ├── Maximum50picView.html        # Problem: maximum characters with visual integration

```

## Theming & Design
All pages share a clean, professional design using a common stylesheet (``` styles.css ```). The design emphasizes:
* Consistent typography
* A neutral, accessible color palette
* Layout simplicity
* Readable code sections and results


## How to View
You can view the project locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/mccormickal/JavaScript_Basic_Problems.git
cd JavaScript_Basic_Problems/htmlFiles
open index.html
```
Make sure your browser allows local file access to see external styles and scripts.


## Highlights
* Vanilla JavaScript only -- no frameworks or libraries
* HTML and CSS structured for readability and reusability
* Problems demonstrate core JS skills: math, string, DOM, logic
